### Hi there, I'm Mike Goatly 👋

It's always nice when you can write your own reviews, so I'll blow my own trumpet a bit: 🎺

* 🧑‍💻 I've been working with .NET since the early beta days, and I've built lots and lots of things using it over the years, web applications and APIs, desktop apps, Windows Phone/Store apps and games.
* 🕸️ I'm pretty proficient using TypeScript and React.
* ☁️ I've also got a lot of experience building, monitoring and maintaining software in Azure.
* 📺 I like building UIs using [Avalonia UI](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia)
* 🎼 I build [Chordle](https://www.chordle.com) for the Windows Store, and in my spare time am rewriting it using Avalonia to be cross platform.

If you're looking for a nice little in-memory Full Text Indexer for .NET, take a look at [LIFTI](https://github.com/mikegoatly/lifti)!
